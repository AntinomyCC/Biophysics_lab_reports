abstract = {A gene encoding a fluorescent protein from the stony coral Lobophyllia hemprichii has been cloned in Escherichia coli and characterized by biochemical and biophysical methods. The protein, which we named EosFP, emits strong green fluorescence (516 nm) that changes to red (581 nm) upon near-UV irradiation at ≈390 nm because of a photo-induced modification involving a break in the peptide backbone next to the chromophore. Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy shows that the wild type of EosFP is tetrameric, with strong Förster resonance coupling among the individual fluorophores. We succeeded in breaking up the tetramer into AB and AC subunit dimers by introducing the single point mutations V123T and T158H, respectively, and the combination of both mutations yielded functional monomers. Fusion constructs with a variety of proteins were prepared and expressed in human cells, showing that normal biological functions were retained. The possibility to locally change the emission wavelength by focused UV light makes EosFP a superb marker for experiments aimed at tracking the movements of biomolecules within the living cell.}},

abstract  ="Optical fluorescence microscopy has taken center stage in the exploration of biological structure and dynamics{,} especially on live specimens{,} and super-resolution imaging methods continue to deliver exciting new insights into the molecular foundations of life. Progress in the field{,} however{,} crucially hinges on advances in fluorescent marker technology. Among these{,} fluorescent proteins (FPs) of the GFP family are advantageous because they are genetically encodable{,} so that live cells{,} tissues or organisms can produce these markers all by themselves. A subclass of them{,} photoactivatable FPs{,} allow for control of their fluorescence emission by light irradiation{,} enabling pulse-chase imaging and super-resolution microscopy. In this review{,} we discuss FP variants of the EosFP clade that have been optimized by amino acid sequence modification to serve as markers for various imaging techniques. In general{,} two different modes of photoactivation are found{,} reversible photoswitching between a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent state and irreversible green-to red photoconversion. First{,} we describe their basic structural and optical properties. We then summarize recent research aimed at elucidating the photochemical processes underlying photoactivation. Finally{,} we briefly introduce various advanced imaging methods facilitated by specific EosFP variants{,} and show some exciting sample applications."}
